# Northeast Lake Water Chemistry Data Analysis

## About Section:

The purpose of this project was to investigate which lakes in the northeast have the most highest concentrations of Ammonia (NH₃) and which lakes have the greatest number of contaminants exceeding EPA water-quality thresholds. To convey the results to a non scientific audience a infographic will be produced.
